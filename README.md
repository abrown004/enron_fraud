# Enron Fraud
As part of the investigation into the fraud that led to the bankruptcy of Enron, 
a dataset of emails and financial information for Enron employees was released to 
the public. The goal of this project is to identify persons of interest (POIs) in 
the publicly available Enron dataset. POIs are defined as individuals who were 
indicted, reached a settlement or plea deal with the government, or testified 
in exchange for prosecution immunity. The public dataset includes financial data 
of Enron employees as well as an email database.
